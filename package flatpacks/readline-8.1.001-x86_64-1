PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
readline: readline (line input library with editing features)
readline:
readline: The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
readline: applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
readline: in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline
readline: library includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously
readline: entered command lines, to recall and perhaps edit those lines, and
readline: perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
