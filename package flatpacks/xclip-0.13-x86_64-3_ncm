PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
xclip: xclip (command-line interface to the X clipboard)
xclip:
xclip: xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any
xclip: system with an X11 implementation. It provides an interface to X
xclip: selections ("the clipboard") from the command line. It can read
xclip: data from standard input or a file, and place it in an X selection
xclip: for pasting into other X applications. xclip can also print an X
xclip: selection to standard out, which can then be redirected to a file
xclip: or another program.
