PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
telnet: telnet (the telnet client and daemon)

telnet: telnet supports the original DARPA telnet interactive communication
telnet: protocol. As connecting to a telnetd server transmits your password
telnet: over the network in cleartext, telnet's use as a login protocol has

telnet: some uses on networks that are known to be secure.
telnet:
telnet: telnet and telnetd were ported from BSD.
