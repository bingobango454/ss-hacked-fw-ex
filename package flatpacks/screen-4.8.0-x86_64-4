PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
screen: screen (screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation)
screen:
screen: Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
screen: terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells).
screen: Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal
screen: and several control functions from the ISO 6492 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64)
screen: and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for
screen: multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for
screen: each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows
screen: moving text regions between windows.
